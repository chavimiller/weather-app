# weather-app

A weather dashboard built with vanilla JavaScript, using the Visual Crossing API to fetch and display current weather conditions based on user input, and is bundled with Webpack. This project is built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The app includes very basic responsiveness, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes, but I’m currently developing a React-based version that focuses on improved scalability, performance, and a mobile-first responsive design.
